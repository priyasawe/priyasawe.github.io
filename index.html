<h1>MINDFULNESS</h1>
<p>Meditation can be broadly divided into 2 broad categories.
  1. Externally focused such as the meditation techniques that involve focusing on an external object or an image - an idol, an image or a flame
  2. Internally focused such as the techniques where the focus lies within the framework of the body as in mindfulness, youga, tai chi.</p>
